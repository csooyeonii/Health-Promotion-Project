# Health-Promotion-Project

This application is based on the hopes to improve accessibility and guiding users to making an informed decision to visit the ED based on the symptoms/conditions of the client. A lot of cases of emergency room visits are unnecessary, and can be solved through visiting urgent care, family doctors, or walk-in clinics.

The goal of this app is to aid users who are unsure of whether or not to bring their child to the emergency room, and therefore help reduce waiting times.


The features of this app include:
- Assessment of the child's symptoms, i.e. fever, cough, nausea, vomiting
- Based on chosen choices, suggestions will be made to the user: Treatment suggestions, Recommendation to visit family doctor, urgent care, or emergency departmet.
- If ED is recommended, nearby hospital locations will be shown through the app (distance in km), as well as the wait times to these hospital emergency rooms.
- Connect to urgent care line

*It is important to note that this application is preliminary, and more data is required to improve the recommendations and increase the symptom choices available to the user.
*In terms of improving upon this application, would be prompting user on vaccinations.
